- 👋 Hi, I’m @brdslj
- 👀 I’m interested in science and exploration through experimentation and simulation
- 🌱 I’m ~~currently~~ always learning new approaches and better practice from my mistakes and from community collaboration. Tinkering with microcontroller electronics for DIY scientific instruments.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects for STEAM which aim to help keep the us all curious, explorative and in touch with our world.
