- 👋 Hi, I’m @brdslj
- 👀 I’m interested in science and exploration through experimentation, computation and simulation. Dedicated to STEM; trained chemist with passion for technology, programming and math - now in data and software for science. Keen on best practice surrounding technical/scientific progress - data, experiment, theory and instrumentation.
- 🌱 I’m ~~currently~~ always learning new approaches, design and better practice from community and collaboration. Tinkering with microcontroller electronics for DIY/open instrumentation.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects for STEM which aim to help keep the us all curious, explorative and in touch with our world.
